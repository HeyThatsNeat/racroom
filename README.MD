## How to use our app
Upon entering our app, you will be directed to the landing page where you can log in or sign up. Once you have successfully logged in, you can choose to create a new trivia or navigate to the trivia view to take an interesting trivia quiz. If desired, you can also utilize the category dropdown to sort through the list of trivia.

When you find an engaging trivia card, clicking on it will take you to the trivia details page. From there, you will be prompted to open the mailbox containing the selected trivia's contents. You will then be presented with questions and their answers in sequence. The number of correct choices will be logged as you complete each question.

Once the trivia is finished, your score will be tallied based on the total number of correct choices and the total number of questions in the trivia array. This score will be saved to your profile for future reference and to help you improve upon specific skill sets.

## Future updates
